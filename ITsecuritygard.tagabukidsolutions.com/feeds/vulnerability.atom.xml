So I have my very curious brain so i know that there's a vulnerability here. The next thing i do is i keep digging digging and boom i found something , i found logic vuln and i reported it to their devs .&lt;/p&gt;

This blog post is about the vulnerabilities i found in buksusisonline. the bug lies in the profile picture feature of buksusisonline which allow anyone to access with just modifying the student number. i also found file path disclosure vulnerability which anyone can view the path of the root file of the site but for now this vuln is consedered as a "noise" or out of scope vuln .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student Information System Can view Student Profile,Grades, Ledgers
and Available Courses for the current semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my testing there's an error, a very interesting error and what i did is i keep digging and i found a vulnerability which i can view the path of their files that consedered as a file path disclosure vulnerability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Alt Text" src="/images/pd.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found out that the profile picture parameter is pointing to the student number(object) which is vulnerable to insecure direct object reference. I'm curious about it ,i changed the parameter and boom i can now view the other student using their student ID number.

&lt;p&gt;A group of hacktivist widely known as "Anonymous", Anonymous Philippines claimed that they defaced the comelec website.
They gain access to the root path with the root privileges by using power and appers to be an XPath injection Vuln. Anonymous Philippines request the implementation of the security features of the PCOS machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours later, The leaks has been copied. The data appears to personal informations containing names, Precint numbers and Voters identification numbers. The good thing is data is encrpted but the decryption keys were leaked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Alt Text" src="/images/lek.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comelec doesnâ€™t seems to take serious security measures, even displaying sensitive info in plain text!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;April 20, 2016&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suspect was arrested in his house in Sampaloc, Manila &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defacing the Comelec Website was meant "TO GIVE VOICE TO THE VOICELESS" Paul Biteng told the Inquirer in an interview. But the data leak was not part of the plan, He added.&lt;/p&gt;
